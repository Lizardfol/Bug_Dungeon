Level 1: The Rusted Gate

Task:
    Implement decrypt(msg) so that it returns the plaintext of the given ciphertext.

Hint:
    The ciphertext was encoded with a Caesar shift of 5 to the right (i.e., A->F).
    The correct plaintext will contain 'KEY=GOBLIN'.

Example (not the real answer):
    ciphertext = "MJQQT BTWQI"
    plaintext  = "HELLO WORLD"

Good luck, adventurer!
